<h2>Create Drawer</h2>

<!--&drawer--><strong><em>Drawer name</em></strong>: Enter a name for this file cabinet drawer. The name will be rejected if a drawer with this name already exists.

<!--&parent--><strong><em>Parent drawer</em></strong>: If this drawer is part of a hierarchy, enter the name of the parent drawer that will contain this drawer.  Depending on the number of drawers currently defined, this field will either be a drop-down list or an auto-complete field (see <a href="&topic:orgright/making-choices&">making choices</a>).

<!--&drawerperm--><strong><em>Permissions</em></strong>: Specify the permissions that will control access to this drawer and its contents. NOTE - This feature is not yet functional.

<!--&owner--><strong><em>Owner</em></strong>: Enter the name of the <em>Orgwright</em> system user who will own this drawer.  Depending on the number of user accounts currently registered, this field will either be a drop-down list or an auto-complete field (see <a href="&topic:orgright/making-choices&">making choices</a>).

The administrator can specify a default owner for file cabinet drawers.  The drawer will become owned by the "default owner" if this field is left blank, or if the specified user account is subsequently deleted by the administrator. 

<!--&drawerstatus--><strong><em>Status</em></strong>: Select the status from the drop-down list.  The choices available in the list are managed by the administrator and should reflect the various status values that might exist from time to time.

<!--&body--><strong><em>Indended purpose</em></strong>: Describe the intended purpose of this file cabinet drawer.  This information is to assist users when filing documents, so that they end up in the correct drawer/folder combination.

<!--&notes--><strong><em>Notes</em></strong>: Enter any notes in this free-form field to provide additional information about the member.   This field is multi-line and can be expanded by dragging the bottom margin.
