<h2>Create Document Link</h2>

<!--&docname--><strong><em>Document</em></strong>: Enter the name of the file cabinet document to be linked. Depending on the number of documents currently defined, this field will either be a drop-down list or an auto-complete field (see <a href="&topic:orgright/making-choices&">making choices</a>).

<!--&infoitem--><strong><em>Information item</em></strong>: Enter the name of the information item to which the document will be linked. This field is an auto-complete field, which will present a list of choices after the first few letter have been typed.

The types of information item ("member", "committee", "role", "meeting", etc) that are permitted to have documents linked to them are controlled by the administrator.  The choices for an information item appearing in the autocomplete field will be limited to those items that are permitted to have links.

<!--&linktype--><strong><em>Link type</em></strong>: Select the type of link from the drop-down list.  The choices available in the list are managed by the administrator and should reflect the various types of link that are of interest to the organisation.
