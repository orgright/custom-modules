<h2>Managing Documents</h2>

A document in the
<em>orgRight</em> filecabinet generally consists of a combination of "cover sheet" containing descriptive information such as the name and version number of document, who (member's name) is responsible for that document, date, status etc.  Then there will be the actual document contents.  This can take the form or either text entered into the description field, or an associated external file that is uploaded (for example a Microsoft Word file) and attached to the cover sheet.

A document is generally stored in a folder in the filecabinet drawer/folder hierarchy, but it is possible to attach a document to an already stored head document to construct a single large document that has separate parts (for example a report with distinct annexes from different sources). A document attached to a head document in this manner is referred to as a sub-document, which will generally not be referenced independently of the head document.

The
<em>orgRight</em> system will extract the contents of almost all types of uploaded file (Microsoft Word, Excel, Powerpoint, PDF, etc) to display when the document is viewed.  Although the displayed contents will not be formatted like the original, it will enable a review of the contents without the need to download the file and open in a separate application.

The extracted contents will also be indexed by the
<em>orgRight</em> system so that a search for a topic or on keywords will find the document if the uploaded file is contains the information being sought.
