<h2>Managing Folders</h2>

The
<em>orgRight</em> filecabinet model includes the concept of folders that reside within a drawer, just as with physical filing cabinets. Folders can hold documents, and are able to be accessed by any system user with permission to open the drawer in which they are stored.  However, unlike physical file folders, the
<em>orgRight</em> folders can hold an unlimited number of both documents and other folders.  This flexibility enables a complex document storage hierarchy to be constructed.

An important feature in keeping any document storage arrangements useful, especially one that has some complexity, is to clearly document where various types of information should be stored. This is done by using the fields associated with each folder to describe its intended purpose, so users can make appropriate decisions when filing a new document.

Folders have a status associated with them, which can be used to close the folder to prevent new documents being filed in them, while still keeping the existing contents available for reference.
