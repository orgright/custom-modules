<h2>Members</h2>

Members in the <em>orgRight</em> system represent people who are involved with your organisation and whose details need to be recorded to enable effective management or operation.

Members may be individuals or groups who pay subscriptions to belong, or thay may be people who use the services of the organisation without being required to pay a fee of any kind.  The system allows each organisation to specify the categories of member that it records, and to assign each member to a category.

Members can be related to other members through a "parent <=> child" (or "primary <=> subsidiary") relationship.  There is currently no direct "sibling" relationship implemented.

Members can be linked to many other types of information recorded in the <em>orgRight</em> systemm, including subscriptions, payments, committees, committee roles, meeting agendas, meeting items, projects, project activities and reports, and documents in the filing system.

Automation functions allow an organisation to create rules to automatically change the category or status of a member when a specified event occurs (eg a subscription expires or a due date for completion of an activity passes), and to generate an email to the member (and/or other people) advising of this change. See <a href="orgright/automation-rules">Automation Rules</a> for more details.
