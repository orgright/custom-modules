<h2>Subscription Wizard</h2>

The subscription wizard is used to generate a set of subscriptions for a group of members when each member is subject to the same subscription details.

The group of members is drawn from the selected category, with the ability to include or exclude individual members from the list.

Otherwise, it is necessary to specify the standard subscription fields, which are the same as those on the Create Subscription page (see <a href="&topic:membership/subscription-details&">here</a>).

The second step of the wizard is to select the members from the list presented.  This list will be all members of the category specified in the initial step of the wizard.

All selected members will receive a copy of the subscription.

<!--&category--><strong><em>Category</em></strong>: Select the category of membership that the subscriptions generated by the subscription wizard will apply to.<!--&-->

The rest of the fields on this page are the same as those on the Create Subscription page.
