<h2>Payments</h2>

The payments function in the <em>orgRight</em> service allows an organisation to keep track of outstanding subscriptions and to follow up on overdue amounts.  Rules can be implemented to automate these functions.

The easiest way to create a subscription payment is to find the member record, select the subscription reocord and then use the link on the lower right to "create subscription payment".  Use of this link will result in the member and subscription fields being automatically completed.
