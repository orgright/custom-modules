<h2>Subscriptions</h2>

Subscriptions are generated against members who are required to pay a fee in order to maintain their membership of the organisation.

Subscriptions generally involve a fee based on the category of membership, but it is possible to generate a subscription involving a zero fee, and to record a "payment" against that subscription based on acknowledgment or agreement from the member to terms and conditions sought by the organisation providing a service at no cost.

The membership functions of the <em>orgRight</em> service can be used fully without having to use the subscription features as well.
