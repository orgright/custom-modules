<h2>Create Member</h2>

<!--&member--><strong><em>Name</em></strong>: Enter the name of the member in whatever style your organisation prefers.  This can be entered as "first last", with or without middle initials, or as "last, first" perhaps using punctuation to separate the name elements.

The name will be rejected if there is already a member in the database with that name.  If there are two different people with the same name in the organisation, then add a suffix or middle initials to differentiate them.<!--&-->

The name is used to identify the member, and will appear in the title of the member information page, and in other fields where a member is required (eg committee appointment).  The name field is fully indexed so a given member will be able to be found by searching on any element of the name.

<!--&address--><strong><em>Address</em></strong>: enter the address of the member.  This is a multi-line field, which can be expanded by dragging on the lower border.  Multiple addresses can be entered if required, with each separated by a blank line and optionally labelled with an initial tag enclosed in brackets to idetifiy it (eg "[home] 123 Some St.").

<!--&city--><strong><em>City</em></strong>:  Enter the city or town to which the address applies.

<!--&postcode--><strong><em>Postcode</em></strong>: Enter the postcode applicable to the address.

<!--&joindate--><strong><em>Date joined</em></strong>: Enter the date that this member joined the organisation, if known.

<!--&leavedate--><strong><em>Date left</em></strong>: Enter the date that this member left the organisation, if known.

<!--&phone--><strong><em>Phone</em></strong>:  Enter one or more phone numbers, with each on a separate line, and optionally identified by a label enclosed in brackets (eg "[home]").

<!--&email--><strong><em>Email</em></strong>: Enter one or more email addresses, with each on a separate line, and optionally identified by a label enclosed in brackets (eg "[work]").

The first listed email address will be used by the system when sending messages to this member, unless a different email is identified as preferred for communication by an asterisk (*) in front of the address.

<!--&parent--><strong><em>Primary member</em></strong>: If this is a subsidiary membership, with a relationship to an existing (primary) member, select or enter the name of the primary member to which this membership will be attached.  

Depending on the number of current members, this field will be either a drop down list or an auto-complete field (which will present a list of choices after the first few letters have been typed).  See <a href="orgright/selecting-choices">selecting choices</a>.

<!--&category--><strong><em>Category</em></strong>: Select the category of membership from the drop down list.  The choices available in the list are managed by the administrator, and should reflect the categories of membership that the organisation supports.  The top element of the list will always be selected as the default.  A membership category is unlikely to change unless the member's circumstances change and they become eligible for a different category according to the organisation's rules (eg transitioning from "junior" to "senior").

<!--&standing--><strong><em>Status</em></strong>: Select the status of the membership from the drop-down list.  The choices available in the list are managed by the administrator and should reflect the various status values that might exist from time to time.  A membership status is likely to change in response to events such as the expiry of, or payment of a subscription (eg changing from "current" to "overdue").

<!--&notes--><strong><em>Notes</em></strong>: Enter any notes in this free-form field to provide additional information about the member.   This field is multi-line and can be expanded by dragging the bottom margin.  All information entered in this field is fully indexed and can be used in searches.
