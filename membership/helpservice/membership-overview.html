The <em>orgRight</em> membership module provides the ability to:
<ul>
  <li>specify members of the organisation,</li>
  <li>create membership subscriptions, and</li>
  <li>manage payments against those subscriptions.</li>
</ul>

Member details can be imported from an existing database by preparing a CSV format file with the details of the members to be imported.  See
<a href="member-import">importing member details</a> for more information.

Member details can also be exported to a CSV file for use in another application, such as a mail-merge when address labels are required.  See
<a href="member-export">exporting member details</a> for more information.

Bulk subscriptions using common details for a category of members, can be generated through the use of the subscription wizard and applied to selected members of the chosen category.  See
<a href="subscription-wizard">subscription wizard</a> for more information.
