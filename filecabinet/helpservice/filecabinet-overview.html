The
<em>orgRight</em> filing cabinet module provides the ability to set up a document management system structured around file cabinet drawers, folders within those drawers, and documents within the folders.

It is possible to establish hierarchies of both drawers and folders to achieve a structure that fits the way the organisation manages it information.

Documents can be linked to other information items such as members, committees, meetings, and projects (see
<a href="&topic:filecabinet/linked-documents&">linked documents</a>).
