<h2>Managing Document Links</h2>

Documents in the filecabinet can be linked to other information items managed by the <em>orgRight</em> system, such as members, meetings, agenda items, and committee appointments.

Any document can be linked to an unlimited number of other information items, and an information item can have an unlimited number of documents linked to it.  Naturally, there will be practical difficulties with making use of such links if there are excessive numbers for any document of information item.

Document links are the usual mechanism for associating information held in an external file (such as a Microsoft Word file) to information stored in the <em>orgRight</em> system.

The range of information items that can have filecabinet documents linked to them is controlled by the system administrator (see <a href="&topic:orgright/administration&">administration</a> for more details).  For instance, it would not usually make sense to enable a document to be linked to a "document" information item, or to an information item outside the <em>orgRight</em> system.

A document link can have a status such as "permanent" or "temporary", though as yet there is no functionality to act on different status values.

Note that when creating document links, it may be easier in most instances to either start from the document and use the "Link this document" link at the bottom of the information display to find the information item required, or to start with the information item and use the "Link a document to this item" link at the bottom of the information display to then find the relevant document.
