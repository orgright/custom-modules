<h2>Filecabinet Drawers</h2>

The <em>orgRight</em> document management function includes the concept of filecabinet drawers which can hold folders just like a physical filecabinet drawer.  In addition, an <em>orgRight</em> drawer can contain sub-drawers, should you wish to build a hierarchy of drawers (to possibly simulate a multi-drawer cabinet).

Unlike a physical filecabinet drawer however, an <em>orgRight</em> drawer can hold an unlimited number of folders and documents.

The important distinction between drawers and folders in the <em>orgRight</em> model is that drawers are "owned" by a committee member (via their login name), and can have access restrictions applied on the basis of that ownership.  Folders on the other hand do not have any ownership or access controls.  If a person with access to the <em>orgRight</em> system can open a drawer, than all folders within that drawer are accessible.

It is possible to construct complex access controls to folders and documents within the filecabinet through the use of a hierarchy of drawers, with different ownerships and associated permissions.

<strong>*** Note ***</strong> the drawer access restrictions mechanism is not yet implemented.
