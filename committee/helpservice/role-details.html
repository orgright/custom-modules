<h2>Create Committee Role</h2>

<!--&role--><strong><em>Name</em></strong>: Enter the name of the committee role (eg "Secretary").  The name will be rejected if this committee already has a role with this name.

<!--&committee--><strong><em>Committee</em></strong>: Enter the name of the committee to which this role will belong, if any.

Depending on the number of current committees, this field will be either a drop down list or an auto-complete field (which will present a list of choices after the first few letters have been typed). See <a href="&topic:orgright/selecting-choices&">selecting choices</a>.

<!--&body--><strong><em>Description and responsibilities of role</em></strong>: enter a description of the role and specify its responsibilities (a job description for people assigned to the role).  This is a multi-line field and can be expanded by dragging on the bottom margin.

This field should be like a summary of a "job description" for the person(s) filling this role.

<!--&multiperson--><strong><em>Multiple persons</em></strong>: Specify whether more than one person is permitted to be assigned to this role at the same time.

If "no" is specified, then the system will not prevent the simultaneous assignment of more than one person, but will issue warning messages advising that there is more than one person assigned.

<!--&allowvacant--><strong><em>Allow vacant</em></strong>: Specify whether the role is allowed to remain vacant.

If "no" is specified, then the system will not prevent the role being vacant, but will issue warning messages advising that there is nobody assigned to the role.

<!--&notes--><strong><em>Notes</em></strong>: enter any general notes about this role.
