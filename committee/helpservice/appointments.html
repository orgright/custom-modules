<h2>Appointments</h2>

Appointments are used to record the fact that a <a href="&topic:membership/members&">member</a> is serving on a <a href="&topic:committee/committees&">committee</a>.

The method by which a member is appointed to a committee can be recorded using a list of appointment types that is maintained by the administrator (see <a href="&topic:orgright/administration&">administration</a>).

Appointments can be open ended, or they can be for a fixed period depending on whether a "retirement" date is specified at the time the appointment is established.
