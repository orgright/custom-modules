<h2>Create Role Assignment</h2>

<!--&member-->
<strong><em>Member</em></strong>: Enter the name of the member being assigned to the role.  This is an auto-complete field which will present a list of choices once a few letters have been typed.

If the member has not previously been appointed to the committee, then a warning will be generated, but this will not prevent the role assignment from being recorded.

<!--&role--><strong><em>Role
  name</em></strong>: Enter the name of the role to which the member is being assigned.

Depending on the number of current roles, this field will be either a drop down list or an auto-complete field (which will present a list of choices after the first few letters have been typed). See
<a href="&topic:orgright/selecting-choices&">selecting choices</a>.

<!--&assigntype-->
<strong><em>Category</em></strong>: Select the category of assignment.  The list of choices is managed by the administrator and should reflect the options available to the organisation for filing committee roles (eg "elected by AGM").

  date</em></strong>: enter the date that this assignment is effective (eg (date of AGM).

<!--&ceasedate--><strong><em>Cease
  date</em></strong>: enter the date at which the assignment ceases (eg date of resignation or a subsequent AGM).
