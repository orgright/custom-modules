<h2>Committees</h2>

The
<em>orgRight</em> system provides that opportunity to define any committees and sub-committees that have been established by your organisation.

A committee may be known by another term such as "board" or "forum", each of which has a general purpose of essentially providing a multi-person unit to oversee, manage, or undertake activities.

The <em>orgRight</em> system provides the capability to manage <a
  href="&topic:membership/members&">members</a> serving on each committee, and which roles if any, an individual has.

Committees may be linked to <a
  href="&topic:meeting/meetings&">meetings</a> as a record of their activities.
