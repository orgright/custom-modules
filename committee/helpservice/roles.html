<h2>Roles</h2>

Roles in the <em>orgRight</em> system are generally specific positions of responsibility with defined powers, accountability and priviledges.  Examples are "president" of the organisation, or "chair" of a committee.

Roles are most commonly associated with a particular committee, but the <em>orgRight</em> system permits roles to be created that do not belong to a particular committee.

Roles are filled through the assignment of one or more <a href="&topic:membership/members&">members</a> to the role for a period.

Roles can be specified as permitting multiple simultaneous assignments.  If multiple simultaneous assignments are NOT permitted, the <em>orgRight</em> system will not prevent this from occuring, but it will issue a waring notice advising that it has happened.

If no member is currently assigned to a role, then it is considered vacant.  If the role was specified ans NOT being allowed to be vacant, then the <em>orgRight</em> system will not prevent that happening, but it will issue a warning.
