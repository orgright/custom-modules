<h2>Assignments</h2>

Assignments are used to record the fact that a <a href="&topic:membership/members&">member</a> is filling a <a href="&topic:committee/roles&">role</a> within the organisation.

If a member is assigned to a role associated with a committee, but the member has not previously been appointed to the committee, then a warning will be generated, but this will not prevent the role assignment from being recorded.

The method by which a member is assigned to a role can be recorded using a list of assignment types that is maintained by the administrator (see <a href="&topic:orgright/administration&">administration</a>).

Assignments can be open ended, or they can be for a fixed period depending on whether a "cease" date is specified at the time the assignment is established.
