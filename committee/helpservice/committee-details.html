<h2>Create Committee</h2>

<!--&committee--><strong><em>Name</em></strong>: Enter the name of the committee (eg "Social").  The name will be rejected if a committee already exists with this name.

<!--&parent--><strong><em>Parent</em></strong>:  If this is a sub-committee, then enter the name of the parent committee, which must already exist.

Depending on the number of current committees, this field will be either a drop down list or an auto-complete field (which will present a list of choices after the first few letters have been typed). See <a href="&topic:orgright/selecting-choices&">selecting choices</a>.

<!--&body--><strong><em>Description and function of committee</em></strong>: enter a description of the committee and specify its functions.  This field is multi-line and can be expanded by dragging on the bottom margin.

Detail in this field can be used to provide guidance to members who are appointed to the committee, on what is expected of them while filling that position.

<!--&notes--><strong><em>Notes</em></strong>: enter any general notes about this committee.
