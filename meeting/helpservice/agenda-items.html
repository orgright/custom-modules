<h2>Meeting Agendas</h2>

A meeting agenda sets out the business to be conducted at the meeting, and provides background information to meeting participants on any of the topics that have been proposed for discussion.

There are a number of agenda items that are usually present for any meeting concerning the process of running the meeting (eg apologies and minutes of previous meeting if this is a regular periodic meeting).  In addition, there will be items of specific business that need to be considered at this meeting.

The chair of the meeting is responsible for organising the agenda and sequencing the items so that all of the business is conducted and any necessary decisions made.  In practice, preparation of the agenda may be delegated to a person in the role of secretary, but should be checked/confirmed by the chair prior to thge meeting.

The <em>orgRight</em> system allows the agenda to be prepared as a sequence of individual items that can be entered independently and re-arranged to fit with the meeting style and purpose as required.  Each agenda item should be complete with any necessary background information or documents required to inform the discussion during the meeting.  See <a href="&topic:filecabinet/linking-documents&">linking documents</a> for more information on linking a document to an agenda item.
