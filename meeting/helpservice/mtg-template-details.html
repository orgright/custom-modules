<h2>Meeting Template Details</h2>

Adding or updating the details of a template meeting are identical to adding or updating details of meetings (see
<a href="&topic:meeting/meeting-details&">Adding and updating meeting
  details</a>), with the exception that:
<ul>
  <li>the meeting date field on the template meeting is just a place-holder
    which will be replaced with a real date when an actual meeting is generated
    from the template
  </li>
  <li>the meeting status is set to "template". This cannot be changed until an
    actual meeting is generated, when a valid status value should be selected.
  </li>
</ul>

Note that the reference for each meeting (including template meetings) must be unique, so it is recommended that a name is given to each template meeting that can readily be appended with the date, or a sequence number or similar when an actual meeting is created from a template.

All details specified for the template meeting will be carried across to any actual meeting generated from the template (although of course, these details can be edited at the time or subsequently).

While agenda items will be copied across to any actual meeting, any meeting items or linked documents connected to the template meeting will not be part of an actual meeting generated from the template.
