The <em>orgRight</em> meeting module provides the ability to set up a meeting and and record agenda items for that meeting. Decisions, resolutions, action items and other details arising from each meeting can be recorded.

Meeting templates, complete with agenda items, can be prepared and then used to generate a meeting with standard details and agenda.  See <a href="&topic:meeting/mtg-templates&">Using meeting templates</a> for more information.
