<h2>Create a Meeting from a Template</h2>

To create an actual meeting from a template, select the "Use a template meeting" secondary tab on the <a href="&base_url&meeting/meetings/template">"meeting/meetings/template"</a> page.

This will bring up a form to enable the required template to be selected from a drop-down list.  Select a template and click "Next".

A form with all of the meeting detail fields will be shown.  Any of these fields can be edited (see <a href="&topic:meeting/meeting-details&">Adding and updating meeting details</a>).  In particular, the meeting reference, its date, and status should be set.  Click on the "Generate new meeting" button when all details are as required.

The new meeting will be created, and another form shown that lists all of the agenda items associated with the template meeting. Select whether to include each of the listed agenda items with the new meeting and if so, what the status of the copied agenda item should be.  Click the "Generate linked agenda items" button to complete the process.

The new meeting should now be displayed in the list of meetings on page <a href="&base_url&meeting/meetings">"meeting/meetings"</a>, unless a meeting status was selected in step 2 above that is excluded from this list.
