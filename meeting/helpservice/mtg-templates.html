<h2>Using Meeting Templates</h2>

A meeting template can be used to create a "template meeting", and a set of associated agenda items. This template meeting stores a set of details that can be applied to meetings which occur on a regular basis, thus avoiding the need to enter all of the details each time.

Template meetings do not show in the regular lists of meetings, but any actual meeting generated from the template will be listed and can be edited or deleted just like a meeting created from scratch.

Meeting templates are accessed from the "templates" tab of the <a
  href="&base_url&meeting/meetings">meeting/meetings</a> page. The default action on chosing this tab is to list available template meetings, but secondary tabs exist to enable new template meetings to be added, or a template meeting to be used to generate an actual meeting.

Template meeting details can be viewed and edited in an similar fashion to actual meetings by clicking on the appropriate link from the displayed list.
