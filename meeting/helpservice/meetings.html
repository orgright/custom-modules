<h2>Meetings</h2>

The <em>orgRight</em> system can be used to record details of every significant meeting as a record of the event along with the decisions and actions that come from the meeting.

A meeting will need to have a name (identifiying label) and be assigned a type.  Meetings are generally fo a committee, but the system provides for meetings that are not associated with a particular committee (such as an AGM).

The date and start time will need to be specified when the meeting record is created, and it is recommended that a target finish time is specified along with a location.

Meeting participants are likely to be both more involved and informed if the meeting purpose and expected outcome is clearly expressed.

Meetings can be created from a meeting template that has been prepared with the relevant details. See <a href="&topic:meeting/mtg-templates&">Using meeting templates</a> for more information.
