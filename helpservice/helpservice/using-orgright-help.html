<p>The <em>orgRight help-service</em> is a pluggable system that provides
  extensive help facilities for <em>orgRight</em> functions. Although the
  help-service does not provide general help by itself, it provides a powerful
  and easy framework that <em>orgRight</em> functional modules may use to
  provide their own help.
</p>

<p>
  Modules utilizing the <em>orgRight help-service</em> should create a
  'helpservice' subdirectory inside their
  module's directory. Place the file MODULENAME.helpservice.ini in this
  subdirectory, formatted
  similar to the following example:
</p>
<pre>
[first topic]
title = "A brief description of the first topic"
file = helpservice/first-topic
   <em>[filename of topic, without the .html extension]</em>
weight = 0
   <em>[How important the topic is on the index page]</em>

[sub topic]
title = "Title of subsidiary topic".
file = helpservice/sub-topic
weight = 1
parent = first topic
    <em>[The optional topic parent to use in the breadcrumb,
      either "topic" or "module%topic"]</em>
</pre>

<p>
  All topics are addressed by the module providing the topic, and by the topic
  id. To embed links, use the following format:
</p>
<code>
  $output .= theme('helpservice_topic', $module, $topic);
</code>

<p>Inside your help file, link to other topics using the format <strong>&lt;a
  href="&amp;topic:module/topic&amp;"&gt;</strong>.
  This format will ensure the popup status remains consistent when switching
  between links.</p>

<p>Use <strong>&lt;a href="&amp;path&amp;example.jpg"&gt;</strong> to reference
  items
  within the help-service directory, such as images you wish to embed within the
  help text.</p>

<p>==&gt; Example: <a href="&path&nowhere.jpg">Don't click this!</a></p>

<p>Use <strong>&lt;a href="&amp;base_url&amp;admin/settings/site-configuration"&gt;</strong>
  to reference any normal path in the site.</p>

<p>==&gt; Example: <a href="&topic:helpservice/ini-file&">ini file format</a>
</p>

<p>If the search module is enabled, the contents of help-service system will be
  indexed on cron. If you enable new modules and wish to immediately index its
  help text, visit the "Administration -> Reports -> Status report" and click
  the "Run cron manually" link.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE: </strong> In previous versions the <em>orgRight</em>
  helpservice did not require the &amp;'s wrapped around the "topic:", "path:",
  and "base_url:" links.
  This is currently still supported, but may be removed in a future version. By
  adding the &'s these tokens are now not limited to href="" and src=""
  paramaters.</p>
