<h2>Project Reports</h2>

The <em>orgRight</em> system provides the ability to create project reports to document progress during execution of a project. Project reports can be created to describe the status of either the entire project, or just a specified activity.

Creating regular project reports is a key discipline in successful project management, as it enables the project manager (or responsible person for an activity) to consider the status and whether progress is as expected.

A project report should in general terms describe the progress to date, any problems or issues being encountered and what action has been taken or is required to address them so that the project is not disrupted.  It is also useful to outline the progress expected during the next reporting period.

The project report can take the form of text entered directly into the project report form, or if the report has been created by a sepearate program such as Microsoft Word, then it can be uploaded into the filecabinet and linked to the Project Report form (see <a href="&topic:filecabinet/linked-documents&">linked documents</a>).
