The <em>orgRight</em> project module provides the ability to set up a project and the activities that make up the project.

The relationship between activities can also be specified so that a project schedule can be calculated, and reviewed as the project progresses.

The system provides a facility to enable project reports on either a specific activity or the project as a whole to be recorded.
