<h2>Projects</h2>

A project is a sequence of activities that have a spcific purpose over a limited time period.  Successful projects are generally planned to take no more than a few months, as longer times often result in changes to the project goal that make if difficult to complete.

The <em>orgRight</em> system will enable projects to be specified, along with the various activities requred to complete the project.  By specifying relationships between the activities (eg which activity has to start before another or finish after a third) and setting and known time constraints (eg an activitiy which must start on or after a specific date), an activity schedule for the project can be prepared.

This schedule will then guide project management to achieve a successful completion of the project, by providing early indications when things are falling behind, or that some activities essential to its completion have been omitted from the schedule.

A project should always have a project manager, who is a person with responsibility for the project plan, including the schedule, and is committed to bringing the project to a successful conclusion.
