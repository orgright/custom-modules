<h2>Selecting Choices</h2>

Many fields require a choice to be made from available options.  Depending on the number of options, the field will display as either:
<ul>
  <li>a drop-down list</li>
  <li>an auto-complete field</li>
</ul>

<dl>
  <dt>Drop-down list</dt>
  <dd>Click on the field and select one of the choices from the list that will
    appear. Some fields require a choice to be made (eg a status value), while
    others allow a "none" choice (usually shown by the first emement appearing
    as "[none]").
  </dd>
  <dt>Auto-complete field</dt>
  <dd>The initial typing can be of any part of the field contents. For
    example, in selecing a member name, typing "sco" will match existing names
    of "Scott McInally", "Elizabeth Scott", "Graham Ascot" and so on. If the
    initial typing matches too many existing possible options, only the first
    12 will be presented, and if the required entry is not in this list, then
    typing one or two more characters will present a list with fewer more
    closely matching choices. Select the required entry from this list by
    clicking on it.
