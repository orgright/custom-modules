Click the "Re-index site" button to force the index to be re-built.

<h3>Indexing throttle</h3>
This panel specifies how many information items should be indexed in each index run (cron job).  Specify a lower number to avoid system performance problems and possible memory errors (this will result in the site index taking longer to build).

<h3>Indexing settings</h3>
This panel permits specification of the shortest word length to be included in the index.  The default value of 3 should be suitable for most sites.

It is also possible to specify how the indexing engine will handle Chinese/Japanese/Korean language "words".  This setting will have no effect on indexing sites in other languages such as English.

<h3>Content ranking</h3>
This panel will allow the administrator to assign relative importance to the properties of included keywords, date content posted, and the number of attached comments when the ranking of results is calculated.
