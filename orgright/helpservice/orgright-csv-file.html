<h2>What is a CSV file?</h2>

A CSV file is a plain text file with each line being a record consisting of field values separated by commas.

CSV files are frequently used to exchange information between computer systems because they are easy to prepare, easy to understand, and can be manipulated readily.

It is usual to enclose all alphabetic fields in quotes to prevent an embedded comma from being interpreted as an end of field marker.

Each record (line) has the fields in the same order, and the first record (line) is commonly a list of the field names.   

CSV files can be opened by many programms such as Micropsoft Excel, where the contents can be edited and changed.  Microsoft Excel can of course also save the information back to a CSV file, or can generate a CSV file form a spreadsheet or database that has been opened using more advanced trechniques.
