<h3>Specify Site Information</h3>
<strong>Site
  name:</strong> Enter the site name for your site.  This name will be displayed on every page in the lower part of the top bar, aligned with the left margin.  It is intended to identify your organisation.

<strong>Site
  slogan:</strong> Enter a site slogan or by-line for your organisation.  It will be displayed on every page in the lower part of the top bar, beneath the
<em>orgRight</em> logo.

<h3>Configure Content Types</h3>
<strong>Content types with comments
  enabled:</strong> Select the content types that are permitted to have comments associated with them.  The default is to permit comments on all information item types except Memos, Pages, and Stories.

An information type that is permitted to have comments will display to an authenticated user with an "Add new comment" link at the bottom of the page (unless comments have been disabled for that page by the author).

<strong>Content types with file uploads
  enabled:</strong> Select the content types that are permitted to have uploaded files associated with them.  The default is to permit file uploads only for Memos.  Note that the
<em>orgRight</em> document type will always have file uploads permitted.  It is recommend that file uploads are restricted to the
<em>orgRight</em> document type, and that the
<em>orgRight</em> document is then linked to another information type, as this keeps the file uploads in the
<em>orgRight</em> document repository, and allows the contents of uploaded documents to be indexed.

<h2>Mail Lists</h2>
<h3>Mail List Details</h3>
The current mail lists will be shown.  One of these can be selected to be renamed or deleted by clicking the appropriate button.

A new mail list can be created by specifying a name (eg "members").  A new list will take a few minutes to be created, as this is done via a scheduled job.  The mail address of the new list will be "{name}.{org}@nz.orgright.com".

<h3>Mail List Subscribers</h3>
Select an existing mail list to use for subscriber management. Click on the
appropriate button to either list existing subscribers, or to add new

organisation members will have the member name and address shown. The
administrator has the option of selecting any of the shown addresses and
removing them from the list.

If new subscribers are to be added to the list, then the administrator has
an option of a quick add for a single email address by specifying a member
(will use preferred email address), or by specifying an email address. If
more than one address is to be added to the email list, then these will need
to be chosen from the membership database. The list of members can be
filtered by specifying a category of membership for consideration.

The resulting list will show those members who are already subscribed to the
list. The administrator can select additional members to be subscribed.
