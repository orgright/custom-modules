Users are login accounts to the
<em>orgRight</em> system.  They are not the same as members, though it is likely that people with user login accounts will also be members of the organisation.

<h2>Permissions</h2>
This will present a table showing the permissions and roles that the administrator has access to.  The roles shown will include
<strong>"Authenticated
  User"</strong> plus any other roles that have been defined by the administrator.  The available set of permissions can be allocated to roles to achieve the separation of function and responsibility required to support the Organisation's policies.

The default is for an authenticated user (ie someone who has logged into the
<em>orgRight</em> service), to have all permissions except for those specifically granting administration privileges.  The administrator role (which is not shown and cannot be changed) has all permissions shown in the list.

<h2>Roles</h2>
This will show the roles defined for this site.  The standard roles are:
<ul>
  <li>anonymous user (ie person not logged in)</li>
  <li>authenticated user (ie person logged in)</li>
  <li>administrator (person logged in and with administrator privilege)</li>
</ul>
The standard roles are locked and cannot be edited, except that the permissions granted to a basic authenticated user can be specified to be a subset of those available to the administrator.

Other roles that have been specified by the administrator are fully editable.

<h2>Users</h2>
This will list the current users of the site (excluding some user accounts reserved for
<em>orgRight</em> use).  Any of these users can be edited to change the name, email address or password associated with the account, and they can be assigned to or removed from custom roles.  User accounts can be blocked (which prevents logins), unblocked, or deleted if required.
